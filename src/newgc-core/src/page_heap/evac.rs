//! Evacuation / compaction pass for the page heap.
//!
//! Sub-phase 7 of the Phase 3 plan in `docs/GC_DESIGN.md`. Cheney-
//! style BFS evacuation, adapted for a page-based heap.
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! Caller provides a closure that walks roots and presents each
//! mutable Word slot to a `PageEvacuator::visit`. For each slot:
//!
//!   1. Read the current Word.
//!   2. If it's a heap pointer into `from_gen`:
//!      - If the source object is pinned: leave the slot alone
//!        (the pinned object stays at its old address).
//!      - If the source cell already holds a `Tag::Forward`:
//!        follow it; rewrite the slot with the forward target.
//!      - Otherwise: allocate in `dest_gen`, copy the cells,
//!        set the start bit at the destination, write
//!        `Word::forward(dest_ptr)` at the source cell, push a
//!        `CopiedObject` onto the BFS queue, rewrite the slot
//!        with the new tagged Word.
//!   3. Drain the queue: each entry references one freshly-copied
//!      object at its NEW location; walk its payload cells, treat
//!      each as a candidate Word, and recurse via the same rule.
//!      Payload slots get updated in place at the destination so
//!      no caller has to re-walk.
//!
//! After the BFS finishes, the from-pages are reclaimed:
//!   - Pages with no pins → `PageDesc::release()` (back to Free).
//!     Their start bits are cleared.
//!   - Pages with pins → generation flips from `from_gen` to
//!     `dest_gen` in place; the pinned objects "promote for free."
//!     Their non-pinned start bits are cleared so future scanners
//!     can't see the abandoned forwarding markers or dead-but-
//!     allocated cells.
//!
//! Pin set and mark bits for `from_gen` are cleared at the end —
//! the cycle is complete.
//!
//! ## What evacuation does NOT do
//!
//! - It doesn't touch `dest_gen` pages that were already populated
//!   before the cycle: their objects keep their addresses.
//! - It doesn't follow cross-generation pointers automatically.
//!   The caller is responsible for seeding cross-gen roots (dirty
//!   cards, static area). Sub-phase 9 wires this up.
//! - It doesn't run the mark pass. `mark.rs` builds a separate
//!   bitmap that's currently used for diagnostics and will drive
//!   sub-phase 8's age accounting. Evacuation is independent of
//!   that bitmap — Cheney BFS discovers liveness as it goes.
