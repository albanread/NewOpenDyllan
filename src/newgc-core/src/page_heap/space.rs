//! Page heap: raw memory infrastructure.
//!
//! Sub-phase 2 of the Phase 3 plan in `docs/GC_DESIGN.md`. This
//! file ONLY handles the kernel-level memory dance — reserve a
//! large virtual range, commit individual pages on demand,
//! decommit pages when they're no longer needed. No object
//! semantics, no GC, no page descriptors — those live in sub-
//! phases 3+.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! A `PageHeap` owns a fixed-size virtual reservation (default
//! 2 GB) divided into 64 KB pages. Each page is in one of two
//! states:
//!
//!   - **Reserved-but-uncommitted** — address range valid but no
//!     physical backing. Reading or writing the page faults.
//!   - **Committed** — backed by pages in RAM / page-file.
//!     Read/write succeeds.
//!
//! The reservation lives for the process lifetime; only individual
//! pages move between states. `Drop` releases the entire
//! reservation back to the OS via `VirtualFree(MEM_RELEASE)`.
//!
//! ## Page size choice
//!
//! 64 KB matches Windows' `VirtualAlloc` allocation granularity —
//! the smallest unit `VirtualAlloc` will hand out as a separate
//! allocation. Using anything smaller would mean multiple
//! "logical" pages share a single VirtualAlloc-granule and we
//! couldn't independently decommit them. On Linux the page size
//! is 4 KB but mmap with MAP_FIXED handles arbitrary alignments,
//! so 64 KB still works fine cross-platform — just a bit chunkier
//! than necessary.
//!
//! Each page is 8192 cells (64 KB / 8 bytes-per-cell) → ~16 bits
//! of object addresses can be encoded inside-a-page if needed.
//!
//! ## Concurrent commit
//!
//! Multiple Lisp threads will hit this when fresh pages are
//! needed during allocation. `commit_page` takes a per-heap mutex,
//! checks the commit-bit, calls `VirtualAlloc(MEM_COMMIT)` if not
//! already committed, sets the bit, drops the lock. Idempotent.
//! Read path (`is_committed`) is a relaxed atomic load — no lock.
//!
//! ## Non-Windows
//!
//! Falls back to a single `Box<[u8]>` allocation with all "pages"
//! permanently "committed" (since Rust's allocator commits at the
//! OS layer anyway). Decommit is a no-op. Proper
//! `mmap(MAP_NORESERVE)` + `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)` support is
//! future work — Windows is NCL's primary platform.
