//! GC cycle policy — minor / major drivers with age-based promotion.
//!
//! Sub-phase 8 of the Phase 3 plan in `docs/GC_DESIGN.md`. Wraps
//! sub-phase 7's `evacuate_with_roots` with a per-heap minor-cycle
//! counter so G0 objects survive `G0_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD` minor
//! cycles before being promoted to G1. Fixes the
//! "promote-on-first-survival" failure mode the design doc opens
//! with.
//!
//! ## Promotion model
//!
//! - Each `collect_minor` call increments
//!   `PageHeap::minors_since_g0_promote`.
//! - If the counter reaches `G0_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD`, that cycle's
//!   destination is G1 (instead of G0). The counter resets to 0.
//! - Otherwise the cycle's destination is G0 (mark-evacuate within
//!   the nursery).
//!
//! This is **cohort promotion**: every G0 object alive at the
//! moment the threshold cycle fires gets promoted, regardless of
//! its individual age. SBCL's per-page age (where each page has
//! its own age field driving its dest gen) is a further refinement
//! that requires per-source-page dest dispatch inside the
//! evacuator — explicitly out of scope for sub-phase 8. The
//! `PageDesc::age` field (from sub-phase 3) is reserved for that
//! refinement; the cycle policy here leaves it untouched.
//!
//! ## Why the counter starts at 0 and increments BEFORE the
//! decision
//!
//! Reading the contract literally: "G0→G1 after 3 minor cycles."
//! Cycle 1 → counter = 1, dest = G0. Cycle 2 → counter = 2, dest =
//! G0. Cycle 3 → counter = 3 ≥ threshold, dest = G1, reset to 0.
//! So objects survive at most 3 minor cycles in G0. Matches the
//! design doc spec.
//!
//! ## Major GC
//!
//! `collect_major` runs back-to-back evacuations: G1 → Tenured
//! followed by G0 → G0. Order matters: collecting G1 first means
//! the G0 evacuation's roots see the already-promoted G1
//! references and don't have to chase across an in-flight
//! collection. (Sub-phase 9 will add card barriers, at which point
//! cross-generation pointers from Tenured/G1 → G0 become a
//! first-class root source. For sub-phase 8, the major path is
//! conservative: do both generations, take the pause.)
