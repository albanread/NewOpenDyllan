//! Per-page metadata for the page heap.
//!
//! Sub-phase 3 of the Phase 3 plan in `docs/GC_DESIGN.md`. The
//! types here are pure data; no GC behaviour yet (that lands in
//! sub-phases 5-7).
//!
//! ## Why a separate metadata table
//!
//! The page-heap reservation (`space.rs`) holds Lisp objects in
//! 64 KB pages. To collect garbage in generations, mark live
//! objects, evacuate survivors, and reclaim empty pages, we need
//! per-page bookkeeping: which generation each page belongs to,
//! what shape of objects it holds, how full it is, where to start
//! scanning, and which sub-regions have pinned objects.
//!
//! Storing this metadata *inside* the page is awkward — it'd
//! shrink the usable region and complicate scan logic. Instead we
//! keep a parallel `Vec<PageDesc>` indexed by page number. 12
//! bytes per page × 16384 pages (= 1 GB reservation) = 192 KB of
//! descriptor storage, paid up front. Tiny compared to the data
//! it describes.
//!
//! ## Atomic / non-atomic
//!
//! Sub-phase 3 keeps fields plain (non-atomic). All mutation
//! happens during stop-the-world GC. Sub-phase 9 will introduce
//! the write barrier and at that point the relevant fields (most
//! likely `gen` and `pin_byte`) become atomic for lock-free
//! mutator-side reads. Until then, simpler is better.
