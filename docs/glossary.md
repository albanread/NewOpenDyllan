# Glossary

The vocabulary used throughout this documentation. Each term links to the page
that covers it in depth.

## A–D

**AOT** — *ahead-of-time* compilation. `nod-driver build` emits an object file
and links a standalone Win64 `.exe`. Contrast **JIT**. See
[JIT & AOT](compiler/jit-and-aot.md).

**C3 linearization** — the algorithm that turns a class's (possibly
multiple-inheritance) superclass graph into a single, deterministic *class
precedence list* (CPL). The CPL is how multiple dispatch decides which method is
most specific. See [Generic functions](language/generic-functions.md) and
`nod-sema/src/c3.rs`.

**Computation** — one SSA instruction in **DFM**: `Const`, `PrimOp`,
`DirectCall`, `Call`, `Dispatch`, `SealedDirectCall`, `TypeCheck`, `LoadSlot`,
`StoreSlot`, `WriteBarrier`. Each defines exactly one result temporary. See
[DFM](compiler/dfm.md).

**Condition** — a heap-allocated class instance representing an error, warning,
or other signalable situation. Handlers are searched dynamically by class. See
[Conditions](language/conditions.md).

**Controlled dynamism** — Dylan's central idea: write open, fully dynamic code
first, then add type declarations and **sealing** so the compiler can specialise
it. Prototype and production in one language. See
[Language overview](language/overview.md).

**CPL** — *class precedence list*, the linearized superclass order produced by
**C3**.

**DFM** — the *Dylan Flow Machine* IR: a typed, phi-free, block-parameter
**SSA** representation. It is the permanent contract between the front-end and
the back-end — the architectural cut line. See [DFM](compiler/dfm.md).

**DirectCall / SealedDirectCall** — a **Computation** that calls a
statically-resolved target. The resolver rewrites a runtime `Dispatch` into one
of these when **sealing** lets it prove the method set is closed;
`SealedDirectCall` keeps a fallback chain for `next-method`. See
[Sealing](language/sealing.md).

**Dispatch** — selecting which method of a **generic function** to run. Dylan
uses *multiple dispatch*: the choice depends on the classes of all specialised
arguments. See [Generic functions](language/generic-functions.md).

**DylanLayout** — NewOpenDylan's implementation of the **HeapLayout** trait
(`nod-runtime/src/dylan_layout.rs`), teaching the collector the tagged-**Word**
and **wrapper** conventions. See [GC](compiler/gc.md).

## E–L

**FIP** — *forward-iteration protocol*, the abstraction Dylan collections share
so `for`, `map`, `do`, etc. iterate uniformly. See [Runtime](compiler/runtime.md).

**Fixnum** — an integer small enough to live directly in a tagged **Word**
(63-bit signed, ±2^62). Larger integers (`<big-integer>`) are not yet
implemented. See [Runtime](compiler/runtime.md).

**Generic function (GF)** — an open set of methods sharing one name; calling it
dispatches to the most specific applicable method. See
[Generic functions](language/generic-functions.md).

**HeapLayout** — the zero-sized trait that makes **newgc-core**
language-agnostic. Each language supplies its own implementation (`DylanLayout`
here; `LispLayout`/`TinyLayout` are siblings). See [GC](compiler/gc.md).

**Hygiene** — a macro expander property: bindings a macro introduces are renamed
(`name__nod_hyg_{nonce}`) so they can't capture or be captured by user names.
See [Macros](language/macros.md).

**IAT** — *import address table*, the Win32 mechanism the AOT linker uses so a
built `.exe` can call system DLLs. See [FFI](compiler/ffi.md).

**JIT** — *just-in-time* compilation: codegen's LLVM IR is compiled and run
in-process for `eval`/REPL. The engine is LLVM's **MCJIT**. See
[JIT & AOT](compiler/jit-and-aot.md).

**LID file** — a small manifest declaring a **library**: its name, source files,
and used libraries. The working namespace driver today. See
[Modules & libraries](language/modules-and-libraries.md) and
[Namespaces](compiler/namespaces.md).

**Library / Module** — Dylan's two-level namespace. A *library* is the unit of
compilation, linking, and sealing; a *module* is a namespace inside a library
that controls name visibility. See
[Modules & libraries](language/modules-and-libraries.md).

## M–R

**MCJIT** — the LLVM JIT engine NewOpenDylan uses
(`LLVMCreateMCJITCompilerForModule`) to compile and run code in-image. It is
*not* ORC; a future move to ORC v2 LLJIT is a possibility. See
[JIT & AOT](compiler/jit-and-aot.md).

**Mark-evacuate** — the collector style: mark the live objects, then evacuate
(copy) survivors into fresh space, leaving the old pages to be reclaimed
wholesale. The heap is organized as fixed-size **pages**. See [GC](compiler/gc.md).

**Multiple dispatch** — method selection based on the classes of *all*
specialised arguments, not just a receiver. See
[Generic functions](language/generic-functions.md).

**next-method** — inside a method body, calls the next-most-specific applicable
method; backed by `SealedDirectCall.fallback_chain` or the runtime method chain.
See [Generic functions](language/generic-functions.md).

**Pattern rule** — a macro's `{ pattern } => { template }` clause. **Pattern
variables** (`?name:constraint`) capture fragments of the call and are
substituted into the template. See [Macros](language/macros.md).

**Precise roots** — at each allocating call site, codegen spills the live GC
roots to stack slots and reloads them after the call, so the collector can
relocate objects safely. "Precise" (the collector knows exactly what is a
pointer) as opposed to conservative. A move to precise per-callsite safepoint
maps is planned (see [Performance](reference/performance.md)). See
[Codegen](compiler/codegen.md) and [GC](compiler/gc.md).

## S–Z

**Safepoint / statepoint** — the bracketed region around an allocating call
where GC may run and roots are spilled/reloaded (`nod_jit_begin_safepoint` /
`…_end_safepoint`). A future move to LLVM's `gc.statepoint` intrinsics is on the
roadmap. See [Codegen](compiler/codegen.md).

**Sealing** — a promise that a class won't be subclassed, a **GF** won't gain
methods, or a domain won't gain methods, *outside its home library*. It lets the
compiler turn runtime **dispatch** into a **DirectCall**. See
[Sealing](language/sealing.md).

**Slot** — an instance field of a class. Slots get auto-generated getter and
setter **generic functions**. See [Types & classes](language/types-and-classes.md).

**SSA** — *static single assignment*: each value is defined once. DFM is *typed*
SSA and *phi-free* — join values flow as **block parameters** on jumps, not phi
nodes. See [DFM](compiler/dfm.md).

**Stub table / trampoline** — the per-module table of Win32 function stubs and
the arity-specific Win64 trampolines that marshal arguments across the FFI
boundary. See [FFI](compiler/ffi.md).

**TLAB** — *thread-local allocation buffer*: a chunk of heap a thread
bump-allocates from without locking, the GC's fast allocation path. See
[GC](compiler/gc.md).

**Wire format** — a flat, fixed byte layout both sides of the Dylan↔Rust seam
agree on (tokens, AST, sema). The front-end hands its output across the boundary
as bytes, never as shared data structures. See
[Self-hosting](compiler/self-hosting.md).

**Word** — the tagged 64-bit runtime value: bit 0 clear → **fixnum** (`n << 1`),
bit 0 set → heap pointer (`ptr | 1`). The ABI between JIT'd code and the runtime.
See [Runtime](compiler/runtime.md).

**Wrapper** — the header word on every heap object carrying its class id and GC
flags (mark, tenured, pinned, forwarded). See [Runtime](compiler/runtime.md).
